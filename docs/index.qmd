# When Aid Funding Ignores Its Own Data

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between humanitarian funding flows, displacement patterns, and media coverage from 2022-2024. The analysis reveals a critical disconnect: **funding correlates more strongly with media patterns than with actual displacement needs.**

## Key Findings

::: {.callout-important}
## The Visibility Bias
Humanitarian funding appears more responsive to media coverage than to displacement trends. High-profile crises (like Ukraine in 2022) attract disproportionate funding, while other crises with significant displacement remain chronically underfunded.
:::

### Correlation Results

- **Funding ↔ Displacement**: Weak to moderate correlation
- **Funding ↔ Media Volume**: Moderate to strong correlation
- **Funding ↔ Media Tone**: Variable correlation
- **Displacement ↔ Media**: Weak correlation

These patterns suggest that **funding follows the news cycle rather than data-driven needs assessment**.

## The Data-Action Gap

Despite massive investments in humanitarian data infrastructure (FTS, DTM, HDX, ACLED), funding decisions don't primarily follow what the data shows about on-the-ground needs.

### What This Means

1. **Reactive, Not Proactive**: Funding spikes *after* media attention peaks
2. **Forgotten Crises**: Low-visibility emergencies struggle for resources
3. **Predictable Patterns**: The disconnect is systematic, not random

## Why This Matters

### The Anticipatory Action Paradox

We invest in sophisticated models to predict floods, droughts, and mass displacements months ahead. We can see crises coming. But we've failed at predicting the one crisis that threatens all others: **funding collapse**.

This is the **Anticipatory Action Paradox**: a system designed to act early, but still dependent on unpredictable donor cycles.

## The Solution Space

### 1. Funding Stress Index (FSI)

Develop early warning systems for funding volatility:
- Historical donor behavior patterns
- Media attention metrics
- Economic indicators
- Political factors

### 2. Parametric Funding Mechanisms

Apply parametric insurance principles to humanitarian finance:
- Pre-agreed funding triggers based on data thresholds
- Automatic disbursement when indicators hit crisis levels
- Decentralized liquidity pools as safety nets

### 3. Data-Driven Advocacy

Better align funding with needs through:
- Real-time funding gap monitoring
- Proactive visibility for underfunded crises
- Evidence-based donor engagement

## Data Sources

### FTS (Financial Tracking Service)
Global humanitarian funding flows tracked by OCHA. Transaction-level data from donor commitments to actual disbursements.

### DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix)
IOM's comprehensive displacement monitoring across 44 crisis-affected countries. Periodic reporting on IDP numbers and locations.

### GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)
Real-time media monitoring capturing volume and sentiment of global news coverage.

## Reproducibility

All analysis is fully reproducible:

- ✅ Open-source code (MIT License)
- ✅ Public APIs (no proprietary data)
- ✅ Documented methodology
- ✅ Version-controlled pipeline

## Next Steps
