A data-driven analysis examining the relationship between humanitarian funding flows, displacement patterns, and media coverage (2022-2024).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains the analytical pipeline and methodology for investigating whether humanitarian funding follows actual displacement needs or is driven by media visibility patterns.

**Key Research Questions:**
- Does humanitarian funding correlate with displacement trends?
- How does media coverage influence funding allocation?
- Can we identify the "visibility bias" in humanitarian response?

## 📊 Datasets

### 2. DTM (Displacement Tracking Matrix)
- **Source**: [IOM DTM API](https://dtm.iom.int/)
- **Content**: Internal displacement data
- **Coverage**: 44 countries
- **Granularity**: Quarterly aggregated reporting

### 3. GDELT (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)
- **Source**: [GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/humanitarian-funding-analysis.git
cd humanitarian-funding-analysis

## 📈 Methodology

### Data Pipeline

1. **Data Acquisition**: Fetching from three independent APIs
2. **Temporal Alignment**: Normalizing to common date ranges (Feb 2022 - Feb 2024)
3. **Time Series Modeling**: Prophet for funding forecasting with quarterly seasonality
4. **Normalization**: MinMaxScaler for cross-series comparison
5. **Aggregation**: Quarterly resolution for trend analysis
6. **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson coefficients with significance testing

### Statistical Approach

- **Funding Data**: Log-transformed to stabilize variance, modeled with Prophet
- **Displacement Data**: Quarterly aggregation across 44 countries
- **Media Data**: Volume and tone metrics, quarterly averaged
- **Normalization**: All series scaled to [0,1] for visual comparison
- **Correlation**: Pearson correlation with p-value significance testing

## 🔍 Key Findings

The analysis reveals:
- Funding shows stronger correlation with media patterns than displacement trends
- Media coverage volume and tone significantly influence funding allocation
- High-profile crises receive disproportionate funding compared to displacement severity
- Funding decisions lag behind media attention peaks

For detailed findings, see the [Quarto documentation](docs/).
